# What's New in X4 Forge Studio

The latest changes, newest first. (This page is generated automatically — see
`release-notes.json` to edit the wording.)

## 0.0.28 — 2026-07-18

- The Forge now recognizes the game's sector, zone, and cluster macros. Referencing one of those (for example a station location in god.xml, or a sector in a mission) no longer gets a false 'that macro doesn't exist' warning, and they now show up in the pick-a-macro lists.

## 0.0.27 — 2026-07-18

- New check for faction mods: if a faction relation value is outside the game's legal −1…+1 range, or points at a faction id that doesn't exist, the Forge flags it — catching the two mistakes overhaul and diplomacy mods hit most. Grounded in the game's own factions, so valid relations stay quiet.

## 0.0.26 — 2026-07-18

- Localization got a second helper: if your mod ships text in more than one language, the Forge now points out any lines you translated in one language but missed in another — so non-English players don't silently fall back to English. It only speaks up for multi-language mods (never nags a single-language mod), and gives one summary per language, not a wall of warnings.

## 0.0.25 — 2026-07-18

- New localization check: if your mod references one of its own text lines by {page,id} but that line isn't defined in your language files, the Forge flags it — catching the typos that show up as blank or wrong text in-game. It only checks references to text your mod owns (never vanilla text you reuse), and it ignores developer comment notes, so it stays quiet on valid mods.

## 0.0.24 — 2026-07-17

- The 'jobs' safety check now has a twin for 'wares' (the economy/commodity definitions): the Forge flags a made-up transport type, a typo'd tag or group, and a nonsensical price (min above max) — grounded in the game's own wares so it stays quiet on valid content. Advisory, never blocking.

## 0.0.23 — 2026-07-17

- New check: the Forge now flags mod code that uses commands or properties a game update removed or renamed (e.g. things that changed in 9.0), so you find out at edit-time instead of when the mod silently breaks in-game. It's advisory and grounded in Egosoft's own Breaking Changes list, and it ignores commented-out code so it won't nag about old lines you already disabled.

## 0.0.22 — 2026-07-17

- New check for 'jobs' files (the fleet & economy definitions big overhaul mods use): the Forge now flags likely mistakes — an invented order, a bad location type, or a wrong ship size — even though the game itself ships no rules file for jobs to check against. It's advisory (a heads-up, never a blocker) and learned from the real game's own jobs, so it stays quiet on valid content.

## 0.0.21 — 2026-07-17

- New: a plain-English answer to "is this just another AI mod generator?" — now on the store page, in the README, and as a Reference guide inside the studio. Short version: AI output goes through the same real-schema validation a hand-built mod faces, and if it can't make a mod validate, it tells you instead of handing you a broken one.

## 0.0.20 — 2026-07-17

- New in-app guide: how to make a UI mod compatible with the widely-used kuertee UI Extensions framework — the ecosystem-standard way, instead of patching the game's UI files directly. Find it under X4 Wiki → HUD & LUA.

## 0.0.19 — 2026-07-17

- New starter: Faction Patrol Fleet — add a patrolling faction fleet that spawns and roams the galaxy, the way big overhaul mods add fleets. Grounded on the game's own job definitions.

## 0.0.18 — 2026-07-17

- Patch-day readiness check — when X4 updates, see which of your mod's patches will silently stop working because the game files changed, before you ship a broken update.

## 0.0.17 — 2026-07-17

- You can now see what's new in each update right here — in plain language.

## 0.0.16 — 2026-07-17

- New ready-made mod starters: a 3-stage Story Arc, a War-Reactive Bounty that only pays while two factions are at war, and a Custom Game Start you can select from the New Game screen.
- Mod conflict checker — spot when two of your installed mods change the same game file, and see which one wins.
- The proof report now lists a mod's save-game impact (which cues and files it touches) so you know what to expect before you install.

## 0.0.15 — 2026-07-17

- Opened mod folders now describe themselves to AI coding assistants, so an assistant follows the Forge's rules instead of guessing.
- Jump straight to where a cue is defined, and see everywhere it's used.
- Errors now show up as you type, not only when you save.
- Generate a one-page proof report for any mod, and turn on optional two-way editing between the editor and the canvas.

## 0.0.14 — 2026-07-17

- Deep IDE integration: mod problems appear in the native Problems panel, you can open a mod as a real workspace folder, and X4 autocomplete and hover docs work while you edit MD and AI scripts.
- Coding assistants can now use the Forge as a tool through a bundled connector.

## 0.0.13 — 2026-07-16

- The built-in AI now checks its own work against the game's real rules and fixes mistakes before handing you a mod — no more invented commands that only fail in-game.

## 0.0.12 — 2026-07-16

- Every kind of mod file (factions, game starts, patches, and more) is now checked against the game's own rules, not just mission scripts.

## 0.0.11 — 2026-07-16

- The backend now restarts itself automatically if it ever stops, and the open studio reconnects on its own.

## 0.0.10 — 2026-07-16

- Broader schema support and editor improvements; first-run setup fix.

## 0.0.9 — 2026-07-16
