# What's New in X4 Forge Studio

The latest changes, newest first. (This page is generated automatically — see
`release-notes.json` to edit the wording.)

## 0.0.77 — 2026-09-08

- Imported passthrough files remain byte-for-byte identical through preview, loose deploy, and release preparation; Forge no longer materializes them as Base64 text.
- Binary, non-UTF-8, script, and empty files keep their raw bytes, size, and SHA-256, including legacy binary workspaces.
- Malformed or noncanonical Base64, and any materialization mismatch, now fail before Forge promotes the target.
- This corrective release retains the 0.0.76 scrollbar warning; it does not claim universal C++ acceptance or B119 completion.

## 0.0.76 — 2026-09-07

- Forge now gives a source-located, warning-only diagnostic when Helper scrollbar reservation is true or omitted (the default) and every table column is statically proven fixed before the first addRow.
- When this warning appears, a modder can fix the layout by intentionally leaving at least one column variable or by setting reserveScrollBar = false in the addTable options.
- Dynamic, branched, unresolved, or otherwise unproven column-width cases remain explicitly unverified; Forge does not guess that the reservation rule applies.
- The rule is grounded in a real current-X4 agreement-sheet run: four source call sites expanded to thirteen runtime diagnostics, while X4 still rendered after reservation was disabled.
- This release does not claim universal C++ acceptance, pixel parity, or completion of B119.

## 0.0.75 — 2026-09-07

- Valid loop-issued tables are no longer falsely refused when frame source order and table source order differ.
- The exact 55-sample agreement-sheet regression now reaches nonzero Paint instead of stopping at that false refusal.
- Preview remains explicitly Not verified in game; this repair does not claim X4/C++ acceptance, pixel parity, full AI Influence reconstruction, or completion of B119.

## 0.0.74 — 2026-09-07

- Loop-expanded UI commands can now reuse one source tint fact when each expanded tint is bound to the geometry command or glyph it was issued for.
- Paint records each tint owner against its geometry command or node, or its glyph command or text ID, and Canvas accepts reuse only when every binding matches. Copied, reassigned, missing, wrong, inherited, accessor, and extra-field owners are still refused before allocation.
- Preview remains explicitly Not verified in game; this repair does not claim engine acceptance, 1:1 parity, arbitrary Lua execution, or completion of the twelve-reference AI Influence benchmark.

## 0.0.73 — 2026-09-07

- Source-defined branch choices and finite preview loop counts now remain stable across mounted rerenders instead of accepted input being overwritten by older derived state.
- Source and target discovery is retained by exact workspace identity, so drawable resolution, UI scale, and profile changes reproject the selected menu without rebuilding the same candidate catalog.
- Equivalent projection reuse is allowed only from one coherent inert-data capture; unsafe getters or reflection, mutable values, or changed authority refuse or reproject instead of replaying stale geometry.
- Exact configured-source MENU, HUB, and COMM receipts continue to separate source-known numeric geometry from explicit preview-only runtime samples. The UI remains Not verified in game.

## 0.0.72 — 2026-09-06

- Preview can now resolve supported deterministic layout math directly from real Lua source: closed numeric math.floor, math.ceil, math.min, and math.max expressions can become preview geometry.
- Aliases, wrappers, and dynamic global reads that could mutate or escape the source math authority are rejected instead of being folded into stale geometry.
- Runtime-dependent values, such as live menu state and branch-selected text, remain explicit samples so preview geometry does not present runtime guesses as source-derived layout.
- Preview remains explicitly Not verified in game: this source-backed geometry support does not claim arbitrary Lua execution, universal helper, widget, or C++ parity, pixel-perfect parity, or completion of the twelve-reference AI Influence benchmark.

## 0.0.71 — 2026-09-06

- Linter-first X4 static analysis uses the configured corpus to catch supported engine-impact frame traps and surface invalid UI layout assumptions instead of guessing from generic UI rules.
- Where supported, the preview ports and reuses authoritative helper, widget, and Zekton inputs from the configured unpacked X4 corpus; unsupported or no-geometry targets are refused rather than rendered as guessed output.
- The renderer refuses to present an invisible or stale preview, and PNG handoff is described honestly as an export of the Forge preview rather than proof of engine acceptance.
- A bounded generated menu has rendered in X4, but preview-to-game pixel parity remains unverified; the UI keeps the exact product boundary prominent: Not verified in game.

## 0.0.70 — 2026-08-21

- Extension gallery and documentation now feature high-resolution visual showcase captures across all primary Forge Studio workbenches: Visual Mission Director graphs, XML Diff Patching, Bulk Transforms, HUD & Lua UI 2D Canvas designer, External Integration Contracts, Galaxy Map & Sectors, Wares & Jobs configurator, AI Scripts Behavior-Tree engine, and Multi-Language T-Files localization.
- Packaged extension assets now include embedded showcase media for Open VSX and VS Code Marketplace galleries.
- Cleaned up UI overlay visibility during documentation capture and verified deterministic live-canvas representations across all core authoring workflows.

## 0.0.69 — 2026-08-09

- Agents can now retrieve the addressed mod-aware runtime debugger through the authenticated Agent API (GET /api/agent/runtime-debugger) or the runtime_debugger MCP operation without opening a browser or using computer control. The read is governed by the runtime.debug.read@1 capability and exact route and effect authority.
- Runtime evidence is bound to immutable workspace ownership and the exact authorized capability and effect, so a display-name match or differently addressed mod cannot redirect the response.
- The debugger returns bounded session and verdict state: coverage, expected steps, and incidents stay finite and explicit, with observed, missing, unavailable, excluded, ambiguous, and unknown evidence kept distinct.
- Each confirmed incident includes a deterministic cause, likely impact, and next bounded action, with navigation to the confirmed deepest Forge node or exact source file and line when that mapping exists.
- Evidence from unrelated mods is excluded from the addressed mod's results. Shared paths, collisions, incomplete ownership, and other ambiguous matches remain unresolved instead of being guessed.
- MCP responses enforce bounded result and context caps, redact the user-home prefix in returned paths, and do not expose the complete game log or accept arbitrary log-path reads.
- The runtime debugger is local and deterministic: it does not use AI to decide authority, interpret success, or replace the evidence rules.
- Historical sessions and unavailable or incomplete evidence remain labeled as such; the debugger does not turn missing observations into a clean verdict or claim that gameplay semantics are correct.

## 0.0.68 — 2026-08-09

- The runtime watcher is back to a compact at-a-glance hierarchy: confirmed active-mod issues lead, authored activity is clearly separate, and cause, impact, evidence, session, coverage, and timeline details stay available through progressive disclosure.
- Selecting a confirmed incident row now highlights the deepest mapped Forge Mission Director XML node; when no canvas node exists, Forge opens the exact active-workspace Lua or other source line in the native IDE. Ambiguous ownership never triggers a guess.
- Deterministic authored-emitter provenance traces real tagged activity to its exact source emitter, excludes uniquely identified emitters from other mods, and keeps collisions or no-match cases explicitly unresolved.
- A uniquely correlated installed copy now merges into the active workspace authority even when bounded inventory is incomplete; genuine collisions remain ambiguous.
- Confirmed active engine failures are retained and stay prioritized above later routine diagnostic noise, including failures observed during startup after a restart.
- Corrected debugger policies can safely reanalyze derived state without changing source logs, mod files, or game files.
- Tagged routine diagnostics remain informational, while governed genuine exact file-and-line runtime faults continue to appear as errors.
- Copyable UI paths now redact the user-home prefix for readable sharing while Forge preserves the exact machine path internally.
- Zero-evidence and coverage gaps stay visible and bounded: unavailable evidence is reported as unknown or not observed rather than a clean result or inferred success.
- Silent gameplay semantics remain explicitly unproven; runtime diagnostics show observed Forge evidence without claiming gameplay correctness or complete detection.

## 0.0.67 — 2026-08-09

- Runtime debugging now identifies the active mod from immutable workspace identity, content metadata, deployed-folder identity, owned files, and real X4 paths, so a display-name change cannot silently move evidence to the wrong project.
- The log watcher ingests incrementally into bounded persistent session state. Attributable incidents remain available after later log traffic exceeds 256 KiB and after the local sidecar restarts, without persisting the complete game log.
- Evidence from unrelated extensions is excluded from the active-mod incident list while its count and attribution state remain visible. Shared paths, ownership collisions, and alias-only matches are reported as ambiguous or unknown instead of being guessed.
- Direct extension paths, Mission Director script and cue contexts, AI-script contexts, and Lua paths or stack frames resolve to an exact file and line and, when source spans exist, the deepest modeled node. Unsupported node mappings fall back to the exact file and line.
- Each known incident now includes a deterministic cause, likely impact, next bounded action, and supporting evidence or provenance, so the debugger explains what it knows and what it cannot establish.
- Engine failures are separated from authored diagnostics, including error-channel text, and from FileIO or other log noise. Authored evidence remains informational or explicitly unknown rather than becoming an engine failure by wording alone.
- Zero matches, unreadable logs, and unavailable evidence no longer appear as a clean runtime result. The session reports no evidence, not seen, or unknown when that is what the available data supports.
- Log truncation, rotation, and X4 profile or path changes create named session segments without erasing retained incidents. Current deploy baselines are kept separate from historical evidence, so an old line cannot satisfy a new deploy verdict.
- Declared runtime cues and markers now report observed, missing, or evidence-unavailable against the current segment. Missing or unavailable expected steps never become an inferred success.
- Repeated equivalent incidents collapse into bounded records with occurrence counts and first and last evidence, while coverage accounting keeps recognized, excluded, ambiguous, and unknown candidates visible.
- The debugger operates locally and deterministically without requiring an AI service. It reports bounded runtime evidence rather than claiming complete detection, gameplay correctness, or certainty about silent semantic failures.

## 0.0.66 — 2026-08-08

- The marketplace page now explains the complete authoring loop: build Mission Director logic visually or edit native XML, then validate, package, deploy, and connect runtime evidence back to source.
- X4-aware completion, hover, references, and whole-project diagnostics are described in modder terms, including deterministic Why/provenance and the boundary between Forge's reference data and X4 runtime behaviour.
- Patch and release workflows are easier to find: preview safe diff patches and bulk transforms, inspect Extension Doctor conflicts, and prepare verified Nexus Mods ZIPs or Steam Workshop staging with rollback protection.
- The extension launcher and Features metadata now describe the existing Studio, backend, workspace, agent, proof, and conflict actions in plain language without changing their commands or runtime behaviour.
- Setup and privacy guidance now clearly covers trusted workspaces, Node.js, a local X4 installation, local-first operation, and optional provider-backed AI that is off by default.
- The stable extension is now version 0.0.66 with corrected UTF-8 metadata. Static validation still cannot prove gameplay intent, and Forge does not upload releases or provide X4.

## 0.0.65 — 2026-08-07

- Agent actions now use exact route and effect authority, so Forge checks that the requested operation, target, and result are covered before it changes a workspace.
- Workspace replace, merge, create, snapshot restore, and bulk-apply operations now leave durable, deterministic mutation receipts. Safe retries replay the original result instead of applying a change twice, while conflicts and failed writes keep rollback and recovery bounded.
- Bulk transforms now follow one canonical plan and recheck both the planned inputs and their paired workspace state at the write boundary, so newer or mismatched files cannot be transformed silently.
- X4 diff and schema validation now use merged routing across the complete 9.00 reference corpus, keeping shared definitions and domain-specific checks aligned for real project files.
- Validation rules now expose governed, deterministic provenance. Open Why to see the rule behind a result, the evidence it used, the likely impact, and the next bounded action.
- Lua registration analysis is Unicode-safe, so event names and other non-ASCII identifiers remain intact during cross-file checks instead of being misread or mangled.
- Script-property validation now follows nested datatype paths and inheritance, catching impossible deep references without guessing when selector types are unavailable.
- Multi-tab Studio sessions retain the correct sidecar and workspace binding across refreshes and reconnects, and busy-sidecar recovery no longer makes one tab take over another tab's project.
- Continuous polling now checks for newer local edits before adopting an update, preserving work made in Studio while polling is in progress.
- Broader stability and containment hardening keeps concurrent work, recovery, process cleanup, and malformed-input failures bounded, with rejected work prevented from crossing workspace or process boundaries.
- Stable Forge releases now generate clean release notes deterministically, keeping the version shown to users aligned with the capabilities in the package.

## 0.0.63 — 2026-07-31

- Each Studio tab now binds to an immutable workspace identity instead of whichever project another tab used most recently.
- Create and switch independent workspaces from the header. Duplicate project names stay safe because identity comes from a server-owned ID, not the display name.
- Agent keys, history, recovery, validation readiness, compilation, and packaging now stay inside the workspace they were issued for; missing or mismatched authority is refused without changing another project.
- Existing active and parked projects migrate once into the bounded workspace registry and retain the same IDs and content across restarts.

## 0.0.62 — 2026-07-30

- Workspace conflicts now show both copy names, real save/edit times, content heads, changed-file counts, and bounded text diffs before you choose a winner.
- Using the server copy first creates a local Undo checkpoint. Overwriting the server first creates a bounded, expiring recovery that appears honestly in Agent History.
- Successful verified deploys now retain a hash-bound recovery for the exact previous deployment. Recovery refuses safely after later changes, on corrupt or expired data, or after it has already been used.
- Failed and dry-run deploys never advertise a later Undo. Post-write validation failures roll back to the exact pre-deploy tree, including first-deployment removal and locked-root handling.

## 0.0.61 — 2026-07-30

- Validation now shows what changed since the last accepted green result: new warnings, resolved warnings, and warnings that stayed the same.
- Background editor checks compare without moving the baseline. A green validation advances it only when explicitly requested, and a successful verified deploy records it after every deploy gate passes.
- First runs and damaged baseline data never masquerade as clean. Forge says when no baseline exists, refuses to overwrite corrupt state, and keeps failed validations and dry-run deploys from changing the last-green record.
- The same content-addressed comparison appears in the Studio Validation panel, project-validation API, package responses, and deploy checklist.

## 0.0.60 — 2026-07-30

- Open Why on any package diagnostic to see its deterministic cause, likely impact, and next action without sending project data to an AI service.
- Suppress only an active validator warning with an exact code, file, and source. Forge shows that scope before writing and requires an owner, meaningful reason, and bounded review date so exceptions stay accountable.
- A suppression is re-proved against the current full-project validation and compare-and-swap protected. Errors, stale files, unsafe project roots, expired metadata, and warnings that already disappeared are refused without changing forge.rules.json.
- Package diagnostics now keep the full finding list and its actions above the footer at supported window sizes instead of collapsing the list into a zero-height scroll region.

## 0.0.59 — 2026-07-30

- Package a mod for Nexus Mods through a dedicated guided flow that validates the complete disk-backed project, builds exactly one install-root ZIP, reopens every entry, and asks where to save the independently hash-verified result.
- Prepare Steam Workshop releases through a separate guided flow that validates Workshop metadata and preview requirements, builds verified CAT/DAT staging plus a rollback ZIP, and hands the exact command to Egosoft's WorkshopTool without pressing Enter or uploading for you.
- First publishes and updates now explain their different preview, change-note, version, and Workshop-id steps. Forge rejects payload drift after the official tool runs and only adopts the returned Workshop identity after a separate guarded confirmation.
- Guided mode is the default and keeps every stage and troubleshooting explanation visible. An optional Settings-only Express mode shortens passed explanations but never skips validation, output selection, Steam authentication, legal prompts, or final verification.

## 0.0.58 — 2026-07-29

- Deploys now require an explicit project target, run the complete project validator before writing, and replace files atomically. A rejected project writes nothing, and each write receipt belongs only to the request that produced it.
- Forge no longer publishes its Studio session credential in discovery files. GitHub credentials are kept by the local sidecar instead of browser storage, are removed when you disconnect, and cannot be used through a read or write agent key.
- Cross-file checks now understand real Lua event registrations and the indexed payload contract used by X4 AI Influence. Commented-out registrations, event collisions, missing writers, and missing readers are reported deterministically before packaging.
- Large or hostile XML and CAT inputs are bounded by explicit size, depth, entity, entry-count, and offset limits, while the installed game's largest catalog and the complete unpacked 9.00 schema corpus remain accepted.
- Workspace recovery now sheds capped secondary history before risking the last known good canvas. Inert automatic-sync controls were removed so the interface only offers actions that actually work, and the dependency/Windows quality gates now run with zero known npm vulnerabilities.

## 0.0.57 — 2026-07-29

- Forge now fits the window instead of extending the canvas into a large empty area. The header, workspace navigation, side tools, patch workbench, and editor surfaces adapt across desktop and narrow widths without hiding existing screens or actions.
- Workspace tabs and side tools can be reordered, hidden, restored, and docked where you want them. Collapse either navigation bar for more canvas space, move the workspace bar to the bottom or the tool rail to the right, and keep the layout after a reload.
- Studio Settings now contains the complete navigation inventory, compact or comfortable density, keyboard-friendly ordering controls, and one-click layout reset. Hiding the active screen always falls back to another visible screen, and corrupt or all-hidden preferences recover safely.
- XML Patching keeps its full three-pane desktop workbench and gains a focused compact layout on smaller windows. Patch Tree, Patch Blocks, Preview, Applied Preview, and Diff-to-Patch remain directly reachable without horizontal page overflow.

## 0.0.56 — 2026-07-29

- Diff-to-Patch now keeps the base file, edited candidate, source revision, and generated patch locked to the same target. Switching files cannot leave wares XML under a ship macro or let a late response overwrite the active candidate, and unsaved per-target drafts survive target switches.
- Bulk Transform can rebalance several numeric fields together as one atomic plan. Add, duplicate, or remove up to 16 XPath operations, inspect every old and new value per file, and apply only when the complete bundle matches and simulates cleanly; partial files produce zero changes.
- Data-only mods no longer need a fake Mission Director cue. XML patches, wares, jobs, assets, UI, AI scripts, translations, and Lua output count as real extension content; an imported empty MD shell is now a clear cleanup warning while a truly empty extension or real broken MD logic still blocks packaging.

## 0.0.55 — 2026-07-29

- The X4 Unpacker and Forge Discord controls in Directory Settings now open with one ordinary left click in Antigravity and VS Code. The extension host accepts only those two exact HTTPS destinations; Forge never opens either page automatically.
- Large real mods now become complete Mission Director graphs instead of a handful of opaque cue wrappers. Forge recursively exposes cues, events, conditions, actions, nested branches, loops, and sub-cues; one unsupported element can no longer hide its entire enclosing cue.
- Each imported Mission Director file has its own visible graph lane, collision removal keeps cards from stacking on the same coordinates, and a new graph-toolbar file picker switches between the full project and one MD script without dropping anything.
- Unsupported or extension-defined elements remain localized at their real position as clearly named raw XML nodes such as XML: <include_actions>. Their exact subtree is editable, while stale saves, root-type changes, reparenting, and edits outside the selected span are refused.
- The Load Mod Project preview now reports domains from the completed folder scan and distinguishes typed nodes, localized raw elements, and whole-cue collapses. DeadAir Dynamic Wars imports with 1,424 graph nodes, zero whole-cue collapses, zero canvas overlaps, and byte-identical no-edit output.
- Imported extensions whose folder name differs from the id declared in content.xml now retain their original manifest bytes and canonical identity through a no-edit build. Forge no longer rewrites legitimate third-party metadata simply to match the deployment folder name.
- Saving unrelated directory settings no longer launches a fresh million-file unpacked-corpus scan. The cached reference index refreshes when its configured corpus root or files actually change.

## 0.0.48 — 2026-07-28

- Autocomplete in native Antigravity XML editors now opens while you type chained script expressions such as faction.player., not only after manually requesting suggestions. Project-defined ids keep their exact authored capitalization in both completion and hover results.
- Duplicate ware and job ids now keep an EXISTS explanation and a visible Patch existing action after the authoritative corpus check finishes. The recovery action no longer disappears when the suggestion popup closes.
- The corpus-authoring workflow is now covered end to end in Forge's isolated extension test stack: ware, faction, AI-script and macro suggestions; XPath completion; per-file base/DLC bulk preview; atomic apply; and exact undo all run through one verified user path.

## 0.0.46 — 2026-07-26

- You can now deploy while X4 is running. Deploying used to fail with a file-in-use error whenever the game was open, because it re-copied every file including ones that had not changed — and the game holds an exclusive lock on the LuaSocket native library for the whole session. Unchanged files are now skipped (compared by size and content, never timestamps), so the one locked file no longer blocks anything. This turns a mod iteration from close-the-game, deploy, relaunch, reload-a-save into deploy and reload in-game.
- A file that genuinely changed and is locked still fails loudly, with the file named. That is deliberate: silently skipping a write you actually needed would leave you with a stale deployment and no error, which is worse than the failure it replaces.
- Leftover deploy folders are cleaned up automatically. A failed deploy could leave .x4forge-backup / .x4forge-next copies of your mod behind, each a complete copy containing content.xml — so X4 loaded them as duplicate extensions declaring the same id. Deploy now sweeps them before starting, and a failed rollback no longer leaves them behind (or tells you exactly which folder to delete if it cannot).
- The game-log watcher no longer reports errors that are not errors. It used to flag any log line containing the word "error", including a mod's own debug output — X4's [=ERROR=] channel is writable by debug_text, so a mod that labels its own diagnostics that way was permanently reported as failing. The verdict now requires an actual engine fault signature, still lists mod-authored lines separately, and names the exact line and reason behind its verdict.
- The older /api/agent/deploy endpoint now reports that it is deprecated in its own response, and points at deploy-verify. It keeps working — tools calling it will not break.

## 0.0.45 — 2026-07-25

- Fixed: wrong-method and unknown-endpoint responses were still returning the app's web page in the installed extension. The fix shipped in 0.0.43 worked in development but not in the packaged build, because the app's page-serving catch-all matched every path and made the check let requests through. Calling an endpoint with the wrong method now correctly returns 405 with the methods it accepts, and an endpoint that does not exist returns a clear 404 — in the installed extension, not just in development. The test suite now checks the packaged build too, so this class of mistake cannot pass again.
- Deploy no longer deletes files it does not recognise. Any dot-file in your deployed mod folder that the Forge did not put there — a tool's config, an editor file — now survives a deploy instead of needing to be listed for protection. Forgetting to list something used to mean silent loss; now it means a stale file you can see and delete yourself. Development metadata the Forge does recognise, such as .git and .vscode, is still cleaned out of the game folder.
- Source-control and editor files are no longer copied into your game folder. .gitignore, .gitattributes, .vscode, .idea and similar are now excluded from deployment, which they never should have been part of.

## 0.0.44 — 2026-07-25

- Reading and writing a file now use the same folder. GET /api/fs/read used to return the DEPLOYED copy while writes went to your workspace, so an edit built on a read could silently overwrite newer work once the two folders differed. Reads now default to the workspace and take an explicit root=workspace or root=deployment. The two places in the app that browse the deployed folder ask for it by name, so nothing changed for them.
- A read that misses no longer quietly hands you the other copy. If the file is not in the folder you asked for, you get a clear "not found" that tells you which folder does have it and how to ask for it — because silently substituting the other copy is exactly what made the old bug invisible.
- Writes are checked before they land. POST /api/fs/write now validates the content you send — XML well-formedness on every .xml file, plus script-property checks on Mission Director and AI script files — and returns the findings with the write. Add strict: true to refuse the write instead, in which case nothing is written at all.
- That check catches the two failure kinds that used to reach the game silently: a mismatched tag, which makes X4 discard the whole file without a log line, and an unknown property name, which evaluates to null so the guard using it simply never fires.

## 0.0.43 — 2026-07-25

- The Forge now tells you where it is. Every instance writes its port and token to ~/.x4forge/latest.json (and one file per instance), so tools no longer have to scan dozens of ports to find it. Records are removed when the Forge stops, and a record left by a crashed instance is cleaned up rather than pointing you at a dead port.
- Errors explain themselves. Calling an endpoint with the wrong method now returns a proper 405 listing the methods it does accept, instead of silently handing back the app's web page; an endpoint that genuinely does not exist returns a clear 404. Importing a folder that is not a mod is refused with a message that names a mod you can actually import, rather than succeeding with a nonsense project.
- Validate a mod folder the same way you import one: POST /api/agent/project/validate now accepts {root, path}, so you no longer have to assemble and classify the file list yourself.
- One call to answer "where am I?" — GET /api/agent/status returns the port, the open workspace, the configured folders, the last deploy, schema and reference readiness, and whether the canvas has drifted from its source folder, including the exact call that fixes it.
- See what a deploy will do before it does it. Send {dryRun: true} to deploy-verify for the exact list of files it would add, overwrite, delete and preserve, with sizes, writing nothing.
- A stale canvas is no longer a dead end. Deploy still refuses when the folder changed after import, but the message now names the exact call that unblocks it, and {autoReimport: true} re-imports and continues in one step.
- Every file write reports what actually landed: byte count, SHA-256, whether the bytes on disk match what was sent, and the line-ending profile. Line endings are preserved.
- Malformed XML is now caught by normal validation, first and as an error. A mismatched tag previously passed with zero structural errors while X4 silently discarded the whole file — the failure that can kill an entire subsystem with nothing in any log.
- Check a single expression without validating a whole project: POST /api/agent/check-expression tells you whether a property chain exists, suggests near-matches, and explains that an unknown property evaluates to null with no error, so a guard using it never fires.
- The action history records what each deploy did to your files — added, overwritten, deleted and preserved, with the full list on the entry.

## 0.0.42 — 2026-07-25

- History entries now tell you what actually went wrong. A validation that found an error used to say only "1 error" — it now names the file, the line and the reason, the same way a blocked deploy names its failing stage. Expanding an entry lists every finding in readable form instead of raw JSON.
- History now covers everything an agent can do, not a handful of routes. Workspace replacements, AI generation, snapshots and restores, settings changes, key creation and revocation, packaging, and shell jobs all appear. Any future endpoint is recorded by default, so an action can no longer go missing silently. Read-only analysis calls stay out of the way, and a canvas auto-save that changed nothing no longer creates an entry.
- History entries link to the nodes they touched. Affected cues appear as clickable chips on an expanded entry — click one and the canvas jumps straight to that node.

## 0.0.41 — 2026-07-25

- Deploying now works even when your mod folder is open in an editor, a terminal, or a file watcher. Windows refuses to rename a folder anything is holding, which previously stopped the whole deployment; the Forge now detects that specific lock and updates the folder in place instead, with a verified backup and an exact rollback if anything goes wrong. You no longer have to close things to deploy.
- You choose how your mod lands in the game folder. A new Deploy Format toggle in the deploy wizard offers loose files (every file readable and editable on disk, and the format native binaries need to load) or a packed CAT/DAT archive. Loose is the default. Every deploy now says in plain language what it actually wrote, and warns you if a packed deploy would bury a .dll where the game cannot load it.
- Deploying loose files now removes files you deleted from your mod. Previously a loose deploy only ever added and overwrote, so a file you removed from your project stayed in the game folder and kept being loaded. Runtime-owned paths and anything listed in .forgekeep are still preserved.
- New History tab on the Agent API screen: a plain-language record of what an AI agent actually did to your project — edits with line counts, validations with error totals, deploys with the exact stage that blocked. Expand any entry for the diff, and use Revert to here to restore a file's previous contents through the same validation as a normal edit.

## 0.0.40 — 2026-07-25

- Load Mod Project now presents both the development workspace and installed-mod filesystem as collapsible directory trees. Expand only the folders you need, inspect nested files in place, and select the exact mod folder to preview or load.
- Large mod libraries no longer require a full recursive scan when the project browser opens. Folder contents load on demand, remain cached while the dialog is open, and keep workspace and deployed copies distinct even when they share a name.

## 0.0.39 — 2026-07-25

- Load Mod Project now browses the Mod Workspace and installed Filesystem as separate, clearly labelled sources. Preview and Load Project use the exact folder you clicked even when both locations contain a mod with the same name.
- Restored Studio tabs now rebind to the current Forge sidecar after an extension restart, so settings, reference data, and project browsing no longer keep calling a stale backend port.

## 0.0.38 — 2026-07-25

- Fixed a blank Studio tab after an extension or backend restart. The Forge now reconnects an open or restored Studio panel to the current sidecar automatically instead of leaving it attached to a dead port.

## 0.0.37 — 2026-07-25

- Forge now packages every included mod file from the development folder, including large binaries and unfamiliar file types. The editor's browser-memory limits no longer cause files to disappear from a build.
- Validated Deploy can build X4-compatible CAT/DAT archives, reopen them, and verify every packaged file before replacing the installed copy. Failed activation restores the previous deployment instead of leaving a partial mod.
- Build output is isolated under the Mod Workspace's .forge-builds folder, so compiling or deploying never replaces the source checkout, Git history, documentation, or other development-only files.

## 0.0.36 — 2026-07-24

- Validation now runs continuously across the whole mod while you type in Forge's code editor, node properties, and raw XML fields. Deterministic XSD errors appear in red, while unknown X4 ids and script properties appear as non-blocking warnings with suggestions.
- The Antigravity extension now uses the same full-project validator for open XML and Lua files and reports findings in the editor and Problems panel automatically, with no manual validation step.
- Unsaved editor buffers are validated read-only against the unpacked X4 schemas, reference corpus, and script-property grammar, with stale results suppressed so an older response cannot overwrite newer typing.

## 0.0.33 — 2026-07-24

- Point Forge at one unpacked X4 root and it now discovers, classifies, and caches the full corpus — base game, official DLCs, schemas, scripts, reference data, examples, and assets — while the settings screen shows live coverage instead of asking you to wire separate schema folders.
- Autocomplete and validation now follow X4's ordered XSD grammar and typed script-expression chains, including project-inferred variables, inherited properties, legal next children, canonical ids, hover documentation, and did-you-mean warnings.
- Mod XML patches are now applied read-only to the effective base-plus-DLC document before validation, so dead or overly broad selectors and illegal post-patch structures are caught. The corpus setting also links to X4 Unpacker by z1ppeh as an optional community tool for creating an unpacked corpus.

## 0.0.32 — 2026-07-24

- XML authoring now has schema-aware completion: child elements, attributes, enum values, and canonical faction, ware, sector, and macro ids come directly from X4's unpacked XSDs and reference data.
- MD and AI-script expressions now complete and document real datatype properties and functions — including chained results such as faction.player.relationto — with hover signatures and return types.
- Validation now reports deterministic XSD violations as errors and unknown script properties, functions, or reference ids as suggestion-bearing warnings while you edit.

## 0.0.31 — 2026-07-20

- Fixed a bug where imported raw XML (cues loaded from an existing mod and kept verbatim) gained more and more leading whitespace on every save — indentation is now stable no matter how many times you save, and previously affected files self-heal on their next save.
- Housekeeping: the project's development history was unified onto the main branch — no user-facing change beyond this cleaner foundation for updates.

## 0.0.30 — 2026-07-19

- First-run setup is fixed: if you hit "md.xsd / common.xsd not found", Directory Settings now has a one-click "Extract schemas from my game install" button — it pulls every one of X4's schema files straight out of your own game, no unpacking needed. It grabs the full set (not just the core two), so factions, game starts, patches and more all get validated.
- When schemas aren't set up, the settings screen now explains how validation works and exactly how to get the files — including the fallback of unpacking the game with any community cat/dat tool and pointing the Forge at the unpacked folder — instead of dead-ending on an error.

## 0.0.29 — 2026-07-18

- New check for station/economy mods: if your god.xml places a station in a sector or zone whose macro doesn't exist (a typo, or a sector you forgot to add), the Forge flags it — instead of the station silently never spawning in-game. Grounded in the game's real macros (now including sectors/zones), so valid placements stay quiet.

## 0.0.28 — 2026-07-18

- The Forge now recognizes the game's sector, zone, and cluster macros. Referencing one of those (for example a station location in god.xml, or a sector in a mission) no longer gets a false 'that macro doesn't exist' warning, and they now show up in the pick-a-macro lists.

## 0.0.27 — 2026-07-18

- New check for faction mods: if a faction relation value is outside the game's legal −1…+1 range, or points at a faction id that doesn't exist, the Forge flags it — catching the two mistakes overhaul and diplomacy mods hit most. Grounded in the game's own factions, so valid relations stay quiet.

## 0.0.26 — 2026-07-18

- Localization got a second helper: if your mod ships text in more than one language, the Forge now points out any lines you translated in one language but missed in another — so non-English players don't silently fall back to English. It only speaks up for multi-language mods (never nags a single-language mod), and gives one summary per language, not a wall of warnings.

## 0.0.25 — 2026-07-18

- New localization check: if your mod references one of its own text lines by {page,id} but that line isn't defined in your language files, the Forge flags it — catching the typos that show up as blank or wrong text in-game. It only checks references to text your mod owns (never vanilla text you reuse), and it ignores developer comment notes, so it stays quiet on valid mods.

## 0.0.24 — 2026-07-17

- The 'jobs' safety check now has a twin for 'wares' (the economy/commodity definitions): the Forge flags a made-up transport type, a typo'd tag or group, and a nonsensical price (min above max) — grounded in the game's own wares so it stays quiet on valid content. Advisory, never blocking.

## 0.0.23 — 2026-07-17

- New check: the Forge now flags mod code that uses commands or properties a game update removed or renamed (e.g. things that changed in 9.0), so you find out at edit-time instead of when the mod silently breaks in-game. It's advisory and grounded in Egosoft's own Breaking Changes list, and it ignores commented-out code so it won't nag about old lines you already disabled.

## 0.0.22 — 2026-07-17

- New check for 'jobs' files (the fleet & economy definitions big overhaul mods use): the Forge now flags likely mistakes — an invented order, a bad location type, or a wrong ship size — even though the game itself ships no rules file for jobs to check against. It's advisory (a heads-up, never a blocker) and learned from the real game's own jobs, so it stays quiet on valid content.

## 0.0.21 — 2026-07-17

- New: a plain-English answer to "is this just another AI mod generator?" — now on the store page, in the README, and as a Reference guide inside the studio. Short version: AI output goes through the same real-schema validation a hand-built mod faces, and if it can't make a mod validate, it tells you instead of handing you a broken one.

## 0.0.20 — 2026-07-17

- New in-app guide: how to make a UI mod compatible with the widely-used kuertee UI Extensions framework — the ecosystem-standard way, instead of patching the game's UI files directly. Find it under X4 Wiki → HUD & LUA.

## 0.0.19 — 2026-07-17

- New starter: Faction Patrol Fleet — add a patrolling faction fleet that spawns and roams the galaxy, the way big overhaul mods add fleets. Grounded on the game's own job definitions.

## 0.0.18 — 2026-07-17

- Patch-day readiness check — when X4 updates, see which of your mod's patches will silently stop working because the game files changed, before you ship a broken update.

## 0.0.17 — 2026-07-17

- You can now see what's new in each update right here — in plain language.

## 0.0.16 — 2026-07-17

- New ready-made mod starters: a 3-stage Story Arc, a War-Reactive Bounty that only pays while two factions are at war, and a Custom Game Start you can select from the New Game screen.
- Mod conflict checker — spot when two of your installed mods change the same game file, and see which one wins.
- The proof report now lists a mod's save-game impact (which cues and files it touches) so you know what to expect before you install.

## 0.0.15 — 2026-07-17

- Opened mod folders now describe themselves to AI coding assistants, so an assistant follows the Forge's rules instead of guessing.
- Jump straight to where a cue is defined, and see everywhere it's used.
- Errors now show up as you type, not only when you save.
- Generate a one-page proof report for any mod, and turn on optional two-way editing between the editor and the canvas.

## 0.0.14 — 2026-07-17

- Deep IDE integration: mod problems appear in the native Problems panel, you can open a mod as a real workspace folder, and X4 autocomplete and hover docs work while you edit MD and AI scripts.
- Coding assistants can now use the Forge as a tool through a bundled connector.

## 0.0.13 — 2026-07-16

- The built-in AI now checks its own work against the game's real rules and fixes mistakes before handing you a mod — no more invented commands that only fail in-game.

## 0.0.12 — 2026-07-16

- Every kind of mod file (factions, game starts, patches, and more) is now checked against the game's own rules, not just mission scripts.

## 0.0.11 — 2026-07-16

- The backend now restarts itself automatically if it ever stops, and the open studio reconnects on its own.

## 0.0.10 — 2026-07-16

- Broader schema support and editor improvements; first-run setup fix.
