# X4 Mod Studio — Prototype Validation Roadmap

**Status:** Draft v1 · **Goal:** Validate the core loop · **Sequencing:** Foundation-first · **Team:** Small (humans + AI agents, parallel tracks)

---

## North Star

> A non-trivial mod, built **entirely inside the studio**, compiles to XML, installs into X4 Foundations, and **runs in-game with zero hand-editing.**

The prototype is "validated" the day that sentence is true and repeatable. Nothing on this roadmap exists for its own sake — every item makes one link in that chain trustworthy.

## The core loop (the chain we're validating)

```
Author → Compile → Validate → Package → Run in X4 → (Round-trip back)
 graph    XML       checks      mod dir   in-game      import w/o drift
```

Foundation-first means: before adding polish, every link above has to be *correct and honest*. A tool whose pitch is "we keep your mod valid" cannot itself produce invalid output or claim false success.

## Tracks (parallelizable)

Three tracks. **B is the gate** (do first, it's cheap). **A is the critical path** to validation. **C proves it.** A and B can run fully in parallel; C leans on A.

### Track B — Foundation hardening *(the gate — do first)*
Trust prerequisites. Small, well-scoped, high-confidence changes.

- **B1 — Lock the network surface.** Bind `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0` (`server.ts` ~L1331); restrict CORS from `*` to the app origin (`server.ts` ~L58).
- **B2 — Authenticate privileged routes.** Per-session token on `/api/agent/*` and `/api/github/*`; stop falling back to `process.env` provider keys for requests that didn't originate from the app UI (prevents credit-theft via open proxy).
- **B3 — Honest reporting.** Success messages must reflect real post-validation diagnostics. Fix the AgentBridge "Success!" that fires regardless of remaining warnings (`AgentBridge.tsx` ~L168 + the swallowed Phase-4 self-heal failure in `server.ts` ~L1140). Default `autoSync` OFF or gate it.

**Exit:** API not reachable off-host, no unauthenticated secret-backed actions, no success message that can lie.

### Track A — Loop integrity *(critical path)*
Make Compile → Validate → Package → Round-trip provably correct.

- **A1 — Round-trip fidelity harness.** Golden-file tests: real Egosoft MD samples → import → export → structural diff. This is our primary validation instrument. First target: confirm/fix the `check_value` shape — parser reads `min/max/exact/list` (`xmlParser.ts`) but verify `generateMDXML` emits the same form, not legacy `operator`/`value2`.
- **A2 — XSD-backed compile validation.** Validate generated XML against the real `md.xsd`/`common.xsd` programmatically (you already parse them in `xsdParser.ts`) — a machine-checkable layer beneath the heuristic `validateModWorkspace`.
- **A3 — Real mod packaging.** Export to an installable mod folder: correct `content.xml`, `md/`, `ui/`, `t/` layout that drops straight into X4's `extensions/`. This is the link that currently doesn't reach the game.

**Exit:** Studio output is XSD-valid, round-trips without drift, and lands in a folder X4 will load.

### Track C — Validation instrumentation *(proves it)*
The evidence that the loop closed.

- **C1 — Known-good fixture mod.** One reference mod exercising the full surface: cue, event, condition, action chain, sub-cue, UI widget, and a `custom_xml` escape hatch. The thing we drive end-to-end.
- **C2 — In-game verification protocol.** Checklist + `debug.log` capture confirming load and behavior. **Human-in-the-loop** — you can run X4; agents can't. This is the irreducible ground-truth step.
- **C3 — Transparency "dry run" (NOT a predictor).** Show generated XML, a cue-reference graph, and surface orphaned/unreferenced cues. Verifiable and useful; deliberately *not* a green/red behavior simulator that could manufacture false confidence.

**Exit:** Documented, repeatable proof that a studio-built mod runs in X4.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Definition of done | Tracks |
|---|---|---|
| **M0 — Foundation gate** | API host-locked + authed; no dishonest success states | B1–B3 |
| **M1 — Loop closed once** | One fixture mod: authored → compiled → packaged → loads in X4 | A3, C1, C2 |
| **M2 — Loop trustworthy** | Round-trip harness green on N real samples; XSD validation passing; drift bugs fixed | A1, A2 |
| **M3 — Prototype validated** | A *new*, non-trivial mod built start-to-finish in-studio runs in-game, documented | all |

## Explicitly deferred (post-validation)

UE5-style UX polish — drag-to-search, comment-group cards, reroute nodes, content-browser drag-drop, the cue-tree/behavior-tree view. All worth doing, none of it proves the loop. Parked until M3. (Note: when we do build the graph model, lean toward MD's *declarative behavior-tree* nature rather than UE5's imperative exec-flow metaphor.)

---

## Open questions to resolve before/early in M1
- X4 install path + mod folder conventions on the target machine (for A3 packaging).
- Which real Egosoft MD scripts become the golden round-trip corpus (for A1).
- Division of labor: which track each agent/person owns.
