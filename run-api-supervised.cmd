rem  X4 Forge API — SUPERVISED (2026-07-09 stability fix)
rem  Runs the API dev watcher in a self-healing loop: if the tsx watch process
rem  ever dies (the crash class that forced manual restarts), it relaunches
rem  automatically after 2 seconds. Exits only when you close the window.
rem  Restart history is appended to supervisor.log (ignored by the watcher).
